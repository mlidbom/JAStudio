name: refactor-to-code-standards
description: >-
  A skill for refactoring code into alignment with our code standards.
  Use whenever finishing any code change or when the user explicitly instructs you to.
  This skill provides the concrete diffs required to know what the code standards mean in practice instead of in vague theory.
---

# How to do the refactoring

* Read each of the files in [the examples folder](examples) in full
* Consider carefully how they relate to the instructions in our [Code Standards](../../../.claude/rules/01-universal-shared/code-standards)

* Apply the insights you reach to the code you just wrote, or to the code you were instructed to refactor
* Keep iterating until the code is as cleanly split into well defined responsibilities as the code in the diffs

# At the end of a development task

When you complete a development prompt and feel about ready to commit.

* Stage all your changes in git.
* Instruct a general subagent to run this skill on the code that is staged.
